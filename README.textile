h1. Civic API - API for community data

CivicAPI is a "GeoCouch":http://www.github.com/vmx/couchdb instance populated with open government and other civic data starting with Portland, OR and NYC data through their open data initiatives, but with a goal of hosting as much open government data as users are willing to dump into it for their respective regions. Out of the box CouchDB provides a RESTy JSONP capable API to all of the data.

**This is still a work in progress.**

h2. Project Goals/Features

* Create an easily consumable data resource for developers interested in utilizing civic data
* Host civic data for free, for any regional government open data initiative
* Modify and build upon the city's publicly released data by allowing users to edit and contribute data, and even start whole new datasets
* Allow easy full replication of civic datasets through CouchDB's replication API
* Create tools and examples for developers to use as a jumping off point for creating 'civic apps'
